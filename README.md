# Copy Highlighted Text
A simple chrome extension that allows you to copy highlighted text and save it to the browser's storage. The extension also allows you to export the saved text to a text file.

### Installation
To install the extension, you need to download the source code and load it into your chrome browser as an "unpacked extension".

> - Download the source code from GitHub
> - Open the chrome browser and navigate to chrome://extensions/
> - Enable the "Developer mode" toggle in the top right corner
> - Click on the "Load unpacked" button and select the folder where you have the source code
> - The extension should now be installed and you should see it in the extension list
> - You should now see the extension's icon on the top right corner of your chrome browser 

### Usage
> - Click on the extension's icon after highlighting text on any website.
> - The text will be saved in the browser storage and an alert will be shown to confirm it.
> - To export the saved text to a text file, right-click on the extension's icon, and select "Export Highlighted Text" from the context menu.
### Notes
> - The extension uses the browser's local storage to save the highlighted text.
> - The exported text file will be named "highlighted_text.txt" and it will be downloaded to the default download folder.
> - In case of any conflict, chrome will prompt to save the file with a different name or overwrite the existing one.
